# **Glossi: Predictive Model for a Healthier Hair**

### Introduction
*Glossi* is a casual and personal project in which I aim to create a predictive model to predict when should my next shampooing be. I have a thick, wavy hair, and managing it is a challenge since it can easily be disturbed by external and natural factors like humidity and wind exposure. Glossi can help me maintain the health and *gloss* of my hair by considering habit- and environmental-related factors. 

### Tools and Methods
As of this writing (July 22, 2025), I am still not set with a predictive model to use, but I'm quite sure that I'll use multi-output regression technique to predict the minimum and maximum dryness and heaviness of my hair.

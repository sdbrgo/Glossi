# **Glossi: Predictive Model for a Healthier Hair**

### Introduction
*Glossi* is a casual and personal project in which I aim to create a forecasting model to show personal hair data, supporting decision-making and personal health awareness. I have a thick, wavy hair, and managing it is a challenge since it can easily be disturbed by external and natural factors like humidity and wind exposure. Glossi can help me maintain the health and *gloss* of my hair by considering habit- and environmental-related factors. 

### Tools and Methods
As of this writing (July 22, 2025), I am still not set with a predictive model to use, but I'm quite sure that I'll use multi-output regression technique to predict the minimum and maximum dryness and heaviness of my hair.

### Status
* 2025-07-22 Data Gathering Phase (2-month duration)
* 2025-09-21 Log: I learned that what I'm doing is actually a multivariate time-series model (recursive forecasting).
* 2025-11-01 log: Started progressing the project and I realized that the project has to explore another approach. Still continuing time-series approach but learned more about the technicalities. Currently open to the idea of creating a public-facing interfacte in another platform once model is polished.
